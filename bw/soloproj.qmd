problem, shape file uses shape area shape leng rather than long lat,
theoretically I'd like to chloropleth robberys by neighborhood and then do storytelling about said neighborhoods likely based on demographic or incomes. It could also be made into a Northside v.s. Southside argument. for effective vis, I'd do the standard captioning and alt text and if I had time maybe add a filter to chloropleth multiple different types of crime using shiny or somthing like that
