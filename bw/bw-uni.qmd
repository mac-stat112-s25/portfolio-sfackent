title: "Univariate Viz"

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.
```{r}

# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
head(hikes)
# Use the ggplot function


# Load the package
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

#| fig-cap: "Distribution of hikes across different elevations"
#| fig-alt: "Histogram chart that shows hikes across different elevation breakpoints, most hikes lie within 4,000-5,000ft "
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "blue",fill = "green", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (ft)", y = "Number of hikes", title = "Number of Hikes by Elevation")
```
