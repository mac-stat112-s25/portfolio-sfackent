title: "Quadvariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  


#| fig-cap: "Faceted by Location, Colored by Rain Outcome"
#| fig-alt: "Scatterplot depicting Tempature at 9am and 3Pm at 3 different locations colored based on if it rained that day. In general,Uluru is the hottest and 3pm tempature corolates with 9pm tempature regardless of if it rained or not."
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, colour = raintoday)) + 
  
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+facet_wrap(~location)+ geom_smooth()+labs(title = "Can the Tempature at 9AM Predict the Tempature at 3PM?", y ="Tempature at 3PM",x ="Tempature at 9PM"  )
```
